# Smart Factory Hub

As there came out huge demand for system stability in matter of high data availability of industrial solutions, it also came out at same weight for system health monitoring and bringing up such supportive tools.

Grafana platform was great candidate for this requirement as its holds the position of leader in observability specialization but further more it showed as a great choice in wider field with its capability.

Things came out as a full suite for digital manufacture supportive system called **Smart Factory Hub** that targets two main branches: 
- **Observability** - System utilities which helps to handle process smoothness and general stability
- **Manufacturing** - Operational and analytical tools for everyday production support and decision making capabilities

Whole system lays on ultimate toolbox consists of more than 100 analytical objects, handy functions and quick data providers:
- Production Analytics - Continuous data analytics tools for process engineers that unlocks decision making abilities based on evaluations of huge chunks of historical data
- Supply Chain Traceability - Operational tools serving as a everyday production supporters with ideology of having an accessible system
- Shopfloor Monitoring - Tracking of key performance metrics in smart factory to ensure reaching out of nominal targets
- System Maintenance - The core that everything stands on, ensuring overall system health

This makes it a hybrid platform that merges observability, analytics, and operational intelligence that is resulting into operational system for digital manufacture.

It supports to achieve stable pillars for building successful ecosystem:

✅ **Transparency** - Allow users, get to know all the covered knowledge of data behind the system\
✅ **Efficiency** - Increase technical empathy curve of user base against the system which boosts problem solving and communication\
✅ **Community** - Interactivity within seamless usage of various utilities improving technical awareness and open space to build community


### Multi-Platform

Easy access to system features being able to control and reach wherever you are by ability to run it on devices with different nature.

✅ **Version "Pocket"** - For smart devices serves for quick access from everywhere to check favorite metric and stay in touch with system state.\
✅ **Version "On The Go"** - For industrial rugged devices allowing usage of factory apps right on the war field.\
✅ **Version "Smart Screen"** - For data indicators with positive aspects in readability of various distances. 

### World Class 

There's several use-cases in other bussiness formats that share similiar direction and struggle with same problems. It is another level of community building when the business ideology can match, like faith that connects people.
The story of water plant in California where usage of Grafana may allow to wreck the barricades that devs face-off by creating their own system approach.
