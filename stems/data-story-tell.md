# Data-Story Telling

For situations that stands on necessarity of act and making decisions, ability to provide crystal clear information is extremely valuable. Once it's added correct psychology methods that support easy readability for data, puzzle is finished and getting a product that data consumers fell in love with.

There's many ways how to paint a beautiful pictures of data with various tools where each excels within its category: 
- **Reporting** - with `SSRS` as most base, but still most important way how to provide an option to deeply analysis and read informations like in data bible
- **Dashboarding** - with `Tableau` in colorful way how to interpret information by creating dynamic tools where reading data is like adventure
- **Monitoring** - with `Grafana` to be able use its excellence in observability area in ability to transform simple metrics into juicy kiosk presentations

Providing such visualizations is creative approach for building the data frontend. 
Since it's about work with an existing market utilities where render speed is aspect that cannot be affected by data engineer/analyst. 
What's possible to correctly handle is cooking a good data logic in behind processes that keep these analytical assets in swiftness.

In a questions of designning whole solution, from gathering data through process code until creating a final product, it's necessar to assemble most clean answers as possible that ensure building a robust enough solution:
- Scope - initial setup based on size of demanded solution in relation with data frequency and availability
- Scale - initial setup for picking an optimized approach for realization that should lead to easy scalability

At the end, proper **communication** is the key for reaching best results and high-end product quality by aligning and understanding of goals that are actually chased.

**Analytical monitoring** is possibility to track real-time or historical production data that could just support executive sessions with its quick insights where making a statement just in time could be crucial.
Milion ways of tracing informations like operational status, KPIs or any other different type of metrics related with manufacture that serves like support for engineers, indicators for workers or statistical encapsulers in colorful presentation modes for executives.

**Analytical tools** give an option to data consumers, communicate with data on a high interactive level that ensures to understand the information and receive a knowledge from it with blazing speed, as long as approved methods of data story-telling are used in the process of dashboard creation that stands on facts of science how human mind is possible to effectively understands the data. The output can be endless possibilities to find an answers for many complex puzzle and incidents where the quality of it is most importantly affected by picking a right tools at the beginning phase of project.
