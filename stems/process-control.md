# Manufacturing Tracking System and Process Control

For productions that combine manual and automated processes, the ability to trace back by using of various applications and tools is necessary standard that ensure high quality service.
Motivation to push into fully automated lines to eliminate human factor where object is smoothly guided through entire process have to be strictly followed by ruled architecture.

Active part of traceability systems stands on ability to control process of whole supply chain.
Based on identification of every object is possible to check and validate their historical data that is collected from various operations of production process.

This approach leads to providing top-notch offer but high responsibility in ensuring required quality. One of most important thing to fulfill expectations is system stability.

Since data is already available in storage system, solution is mainly focuesed on searching speed and its reading performance. 
At traffic load of million rows per month it leads to heartbeat pulse like requests on database system. At this scale is important to having some sort of **monitoring** over such system.

Another supportive element in stack is ability to manage and use the system easily by providing **access** and ensuring **configurability**.
It's a set of tools ensuring operational excellence by accessing essential elements of system.
