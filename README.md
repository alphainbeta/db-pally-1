## 🧙 Levelling | Career Evolution

This section tells story about adventure called **Dawn of QRing**. Where my avatar was spawned, what gear I get at the beginning and how all it ends. By chronological storytelling it covers career highlights for specified time range.

### Base Camp

At 2017/18, Industry 4.0 era is peaking and becoming with high hopes in fresh open plant of long-year existing automotive direct corporate with specialization on high-pressure die casting.
Digitalization of manufacture connected with QR codes everywhere brings on the table options like traceability of supply chain or high-tech features like digital twins. 
Despite scale of company with 25 000 of total employees and 40 plants worldwide, at that time whole project feels challenging and having a startup character.
Ambitions where big, become a leader in this field among industrial concurrency with similar specs. Based on, workload on dev teams was at same size. 
My position at this mission had to be a major data guy whos by evolving its skills through gained experience at developing and deploying phases became same leader in this field as company goals are.

### Final Boss

What about **Loot**:
- Gained wisdom and healthy overlook from experience based on being overloaded in structures that are built from the ground
  - *To be part of startup give an extreme curve of lessons learned by opportunity of being dragged into living problems that involving awareness of mistakes in future applying principles of desging phases, awareness of every aspect for project leading chain since having to be exposed to situations that force to think about the best way, how to handle a given phase and most important, awareness of real value for humanity in scenarios that lacks of automation when people needs to cooperate and communicate*

- Achieving visionary for certain period that focus on being competitive in digitalization field and leadership
  - *Exceptional results earned under guidence of best possible leadership, approved by representing on various sessions of manufacture market*
 
What about **Next Level**:
- Values
  - *Closer mind-match with final product that align with personal vision of work/life*

- Scale
  - *Natural exposure to challenge but in much healthier manner where system already holds knowledge of base principles for success*


## ⚔️ Armory | Tech Stack & Solutions

This section zoom-in the gear obtained within adventure and tools used on this journey. It's about technology used in industry specialization with proven use in described real-world scenarios.

## 🛡️ Guild | Team & Enviroment

No any quest on adventure, nor defeating boss in final raid is possible without good company of same level adventurers. This section give a look especially on team work that creates complete ecosystem that ensures vital functionality of digital world. 
<br> 

<img width="600" height="550" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/085d32e9-cce8-4d9a-9120-595c5661d73e" />

Maturity of technological base created at scope that is fueled with more than 1K employee base, stands on 3 core pillars that tighly cooperate together and ensures vitals orchestration of digital transformation.
- **Infastructure** - ensuring stable ground for existing data collection technologies to provide baseline for get work with data, additionaly by taking care of system elements with maintanability and configurability
- **Solution** - ensuring high quality service by providing analytical tools and operational logics that are created with optimized methods and proper flows in solution dev cycle 
- **Health** - ensuring major coverage of aspects that ensures system stability including solutions architecture, making communication bridges, simplyfying tasks complexity, reviewing production release candidates and oftenly solving critical situations with troubleshoting where all that creates technical leadership with goal to stick all the team-good together 

[**Smart Factory Hub**](https://github.com/alphainbeta/db-pally-1/blob/main/stems/smart-factory-hub.md) holds the core position as a operational system that controls digital manufacture with ensuring system vitality, providing operational inteligence and creating stable ground for data-driven industry.

From such scale of employee base the heart of service providing is constantly forced to situations that requires clearifying in **communications on different type of level**
- **Service requestors** - high level officers of various divisions are requesting their demands in format of simplyfied ideas that are necessar to clarify in collaborative communication on business level
- **Support engineering** - for keeping heart alive fueling it with blood is necessarity of life, similiar as it's in this case knowledge and experience providing from additional fields like management, automatization or information technologies where is important to find intersection on professional communication level

Based on **scale of requested solution** and available team structures is possible to pick optimal approach of devops cycle for realization the project. 
- **Advanced** - when solution has a global impact across whole firm structure that should be adapted most robust way as possible to cover different types of use cases and acts of tool behaviour
- **Simple** - when solution should be delivered in shorter time range but kept  enough with scalable design that is possible to reach with available technology assets

This puzzle is etalon of how soft and hard skill stack creates a structure that grades maturity of data culture that affects the quality of end product.
